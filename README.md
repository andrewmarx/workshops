**2018-04 GIS in R**: A workshop I gave to the Wildlife Graduate Student Assocation in April of 2018. Illustrates some of the tools available for working with spatial data (vector and raster) in R.

**2018-03 3D Printing for Scientists**: A workshop I was invited to give at the 2018 FL TWS conference. The first pdf was a practice run given to the Wildlife Graduate Association in March of 2018. The second pdf was presented at the TWS meeting in April. The goal of the workshop was to give scientists a basic foundation in the terms, concepts, and potential applications of 3D printing. The second half of the workshop included hands on time with Wings3D and FreeCAD to introduce them to different approaches for creating 3D models.

**2016-03 Intro to SQL**: A workshop I gave to the Wildlife Graduate Student Assocation in March of 2016. Uses SQLite to cover the basics of table design, SQL, and how to connect to a database using R. I also used these materials for one or two small lab workshops.
